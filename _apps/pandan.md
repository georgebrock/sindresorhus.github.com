<h3 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

[Send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback/?product=Pandan&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### Can you make the history be further back than 30 days?

The history is intentionally limited. Pandan is about time awareness right now, not analyzing past behavior. If you need more stats and graphs, check out the system [Screen Time](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT210387) feature.

#### Why is this free without ads?

I just enjoy making Mac apps. I earn money on other apps.

#### Where can I find the changelog?

Go [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1569600264) and click “Version History”.

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

I don't have any immediate plans to localize the app.
