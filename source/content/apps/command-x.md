#### The app does not show up in the menu bar

macOS hides menu bar apps when there is no space left in the menu bar. This is a common problem on MacBooks with a notch. Try quitting some menu bar apps to free up space. If this does not solve it, try quitting Bartender if you have it installed.

#### Where can I find the changelog?

Go [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6448461551) and click “Version History”.

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

I don't have any plans to localize the app.
